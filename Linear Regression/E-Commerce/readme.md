# E-commerce Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior and predict yearly spending. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the implementation of a linear regression model.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Linear Regression E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website)
- **Description**: The dataset contains various features such as average session length, time on app, time on website, length of membership, and yearly amount spent by customers.

## Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and relationships between features.
2. Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict the yearly amount spent by customers.

## Techniques and Algorithms
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore relationships between features.
  - Joint plots and pair plots to understand feature interactions.
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Feature selection and train-test split using Scikit-learn.
  - Model training and coefficient extraction.
  - Model evaluation using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Key Findings
- Visualizations showed that "Length of Membership" and "Time on App" had significant relationships with the yearly amount spent.
- The linear regression model provided insights into the importance of different features, with coefficients indicating their impact on yearly spending.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data consistency and handling any missing values.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using residual plots and statistical tests.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn plotly

2. **Load the Dataset**: 

3. **Ensure the Ecommerce.csv file is in the working directory**.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook: Execute the cells in the provided notebook to reproduce the analysis and results.**

## Files
 - **E-commerce.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and model implementation.
 - **Ecommerce.csv:** Dataset file (make sure to include this in the repository if possible).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and build predictive models using Python. The findings and model can help businesses understand customer behavior and optimize their strategies accordingly.
